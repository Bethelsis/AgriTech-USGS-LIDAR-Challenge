=======
This project tries to build a python package for AgriTech.This project aimed to know how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on farms. The purpose of this project is to build models of water flow and predict maize harvest if we better understand how water flows through a field, and which parts are likely to be flooded or too dry.

A python module that can be used to fetch, visualize, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data.
